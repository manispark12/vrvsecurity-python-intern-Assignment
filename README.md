# Security Analysis using Python

## Overview

This project leverages Python to perform security analysis on systems, networks, and applications. The goal is to automate the detection of vulnerabilities, monitor for security threats, and provide detailed reports on the security posture of a system. It covers a range of tools and techniques such as network scanning, vulnerability assessment, password cracking, and malware analysis.

## Features

- **Network Scanning**: Use tools like `scapy` and `socket` to discover devices and open ports on a network.
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Integration with tools such as `Nmap` and `OpenVAS` to assess vulnerabilities in networks or applications.
- **Password Cracking**: Analyze password strength using tools like `hashlib` and `John the Ripper`.
- **Malware Analysis**: Use Python libraries to identify suspicious files and behaviors.
- **Log Analysis**: Parse and analyze system and security logs to detect malicious activities.
- **Reports**: Generate security reports that include findings, recommendations, and remediation steps.
